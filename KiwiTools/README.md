# KiwiTools

## Introduction
The KiwiTools contains command line applications which generate declaration files for TypeScript programming.

## Download
This package can not be distributed by AppStore because the store does not accept command line tools.

The package can be downloaded from this site in the future.
(Now, you can down load the [source code](https://github.com/steelwheels/KiwiScript/tree/master/KiwiTools) only.)
